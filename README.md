Just a start

Everyone who knows me think I am a geek in chemical engineering. So it is reasonable that I should find a chemical engineer job or continue PhD degree. But the reality is that it is very hard to for PhD graduate to find a professor job especially for us international students and also very hard to find a entry level chemical engineer job in recession. But it is relative easy to find a job related to programmer and math. In my master research, I did lots of things on scientific computing in chemical engineering and gradually like programming in python and matlab, a little java. I also got an account from Compute Canada from Queen's University and run my programs on clusters. So I am thinking about to learn more about computer science or data science and find a job related. For these reasons, I find the free code camp and build this first GitHub account for start.
